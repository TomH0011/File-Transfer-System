# File-Transfer-System
Transfer files from server to client using AES 128 Encryption and decryption

On the server side alter "file_path_name" to the file path you want to send to client.

On the client side alter "some_other_path_name\received_file.pdf" to some some file pathj where you want it to be saved
followed by the name you want your file to haver I chose PDF for example here.

if you want to alter the keys in either server or client side remember to change it for the other side
i.e. changing server keys will require manual alterinmg of client keys
